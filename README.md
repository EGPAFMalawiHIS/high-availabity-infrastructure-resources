## Quick definifitions

What is High Availability? High availability is a function of system design that allows an application to automatically restart or reroute work to another capable system in the event of a failure. In terms of servers, there are a few different technologies needed to set up a highly available system. There must be a component that can redirect the work and there must be a mechanism to monitor for failure and transition the system if an interruption is detected.
